## Compilation

The project has been compiled with _Depack_ which requires _Closure Compiler_ installed locally. The best way to do it is to install it in the home directory as a `node_modules` dependency:

```
cd ~
yarn init
yarn add google-closure-compiler-java
```

_Depack_ will perform compilation in advanced mode, merging all dependencies together and optimising the code.
